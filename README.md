# Java Full Stack Junior Development (JFSJD) - Final Project


**General Objectives**

Implement a fully working web application with the following layers:
* Persistence: MySQL Database.
* Backend: REST API with Java and Spring Boot. 
* Frontend: JavaScript + CSS + HTML.

**Details**

* You will work in **groups of 3-4 people** as assigned by the instructor. 
* Each Sprint will have a **retrospective** at the end.
* At the end of the project, you and your group will do a **final project presentation** to the entire class.

You can use [this old group activity](https://github.com/reanderson89/JFS_NAT_006_Activity_Bank/blob/main/01-git-github-scrum/04-Scrum-Github-ABC-Activity/README.md) we did to help you get started with setting up your github repo, adding collaborators, setting security on main, common git commands, setting up a project board vie the "scrum walkthrough" link, and publishing your page.
